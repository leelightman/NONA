title="#">www.returnsforsale.com</a>.  We take all our returns that can't be sold as new from our shopify sales and amazon returns and set up a DRIP campaign with ReturnsForSale.  They drip in price until the sell.  It takes less than a minute to post and it seriously moved through all our returns that built up in the corner.  It's been amazing.<br>Amazon is so liberal with returns, it has not been good for us, we get thing totally used back and normally just put them in the corner.  Now we move them within a week really easily.  <br>I mean, returns are never a money maker, but with this, we still make a little, even after all the shipping around and such or at least break even.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

clear to me if there is a law that specifies whether a return must be valued at the amount originally paid for an item or if it can be determined as the value reflecting the current price in the store at the time of the return. Some stores do not provide gift receipts with encoded or scannable prices that show what was originally paid, especially if an item was purchased at a different location. Customers may not be aware that their items were purchased for full price but their store credit is now 25% less because, though they had gift receipts, the employee at the location conducting their return simply scanned the upc on the tags, never verifying whether that was actually the amount originally paid. Such a practice seems a bit dodgy to me, that’s why I hope there is a law that clarifies.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a

data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>The consumer is too demanding and sloth like today.  41% buy with the intention or returning and 89% of these people returning is a great thing?  This is not sustainable, this will be helpful to brick and mortar at least, it will reverse things, Online items will be super expensive to facilitate 41% of purchasers returning the majority of their goods.  Shipping is not free, it's always rolled into price and you get fleeced everytime you order more than one item since it's impossible to combine the shipping.  If shipping on average is costing them $6.75 and 41% return what they buy that's over $13 in aquisition costs on shipping alone to get a serial return customer.  If you're a small guy wanting to sell online going forward, you'd be best to chose a product that can have the Jerry Seinfeld Fruit policy applied.  Inexpensive items that people won't bother to return because they know it's a gamble going in.  It should also be something you make since nobody else will carry it and these ridiculous policies can be avoided.  With no option to buy elsewhere where the idiots will cater to people who have these terrible shopping habbits, the consumer will pay a fair price for your item and will also pay for the shipping without the need to be concerned with being able to return the item before they even buy it and they'll be happy to do it because it'll be able to be priced cheaper than average since you're not accounting for phantom costs that will make you lose your shirt.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see

Customers are global, how would that even work?  Besides returns are not being caused by faulty merchandise, these are ridiculous policies enacted by desperate retailers/sellers who are doing anything to get that sale.  Nashbar bikes had a policy of lifetime warranty for any reason on the bikes they sell, you could return the bike for any reason.  My friend bought one and on several occassions he considered returning his bike so he could pay rent (He's obviously one to make great decisions in order to find himself in that position repeatedly but.... The policy works for him, a broke guy with access to an indefinate rental, hell not even that because he gets his money back completely if he returns it).  That company went out of business.  Amazon now has their apparel program where you chose up to 8 items and only pay for what you don't return.  I guarantee they'll shut that down before too long.  The economy isn't as good as they say, people hold onto their money because they are cautious with their money and retailers are pulling out these desperate policies in a pathetic attempt to get that sale.  Returns are high because of the policies set by the retailers, their policies are lenient because they're desperate and competing with giants like Amazon that cater to the sloths of society that can't be bothered to peel themselves off the couch.  Just look at their commercials and pay attention to whom they're advertising to.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more

I know from experience that this can be cause of at least half the returns for apparel based on the metrics and quantification I have access to at my current position.  In a typical supply chain, goods are manufactured to order and specification and said goods are shipped to the seller.  The seller or online retailer then ships the goods to the customer.  The inspections take place before the goods leave the country of origin and again at the point of delivery.  How would the seller know the goods he ordered and shipped to his customers are to his specifications?  It is expensive but it is the cost of doing business in the current economy.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"

dir="auto"><div><p>I have personally set up inspection schemes for different companies using 3rd party inspection services that have offices in every corner of the globe.  In addition I have set up teams to inspect at the delivery point in US distribution centers.  You say that is expensive but it is the cost of doing online business the correct way. I have successfully lowered return rates that were carefully calculated.  Took 2 years but it can be done. if you don't inspect, you don't know what your vendors are really shipping to you.  My inspection teams have found mis-labeled sizes, wrong colors mis-labeled, out of tolerance specs, poor workmanship etc. I have been able to get the vendors to pay more attention to the product they are producing or they will get it back and  not get paid for it if it is wrong.  I have been doing this in apparel for 20 years. I know what I am talking about.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see
